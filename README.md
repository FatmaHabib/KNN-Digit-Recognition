# KNN-Digit-Recognition
A digit recognition application that uses K-nearest neighbor algorithm to classify the digits using the Mindst dataset. The project features a drawing mode in which the user can draw a digit then classify it. The project was made to test the accuracy and performance of the KNN algorithm in identifying digits.
